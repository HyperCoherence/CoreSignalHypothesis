Goal
Reduce peak-period traffic congestion by 40% within 5 years, while sustaining economic growth and improving quality of life. Anchor the program around faster, more reliable non-car options, fair pricing of scarce road space, smarter operations, and land-use changes that shorten trips.

How “40% less congestion” will be measured
- Primary: Vehicle Hours of Delay (VHD) and Travel Time Index (TTI) on the peak-period network.
- Secondary: Reliability (Buffer Index), person-throughput per corridor, average commute time, per-capita vehicle miles traveled (VMT), transit ridership and on-time performance, serious injuries/fatalities, PM2.5/NOx, access to jobs within 45 minutes by transit, and customer satisfaction.

Governance and delivery
- Establish a Mayor’s Mobility Delivery Unit with authority to coordinate transport, planning, police, schools, and economic development; include an Equity and Small Business Advisory Panel.
- Create a citywide Mobility Data Trust to integrate public and private mobility data (transit, ridehail, freight, parking, signals) with strict privacy and cybersecurity standards.
- Adopt a “pilot, evaluate, scale” playbook with quarterly dashboards and an annual independent audit.

Portfolio overview and indicative contribution to congestion reduction (ranges account for overlap)
- Congestion pricing (cordon and/or corridor) with revenue recycling: 15–25%
- Transit priority and service upgrades (BRT, frequency, reliability): 8–15%
- Parking reform and curb management: 6–10%
- Active mobility network (protected bike lanes, safer walking): 5–8%
- Employer travel demand management and telework/flexible hours: 6–12%
- Smart operations (adaptive signals, TSP, incident response): 4–8%
- Freight efficiency (microhubs, delivery windows, curb tools): 3–6%
Combined, an achievable 40%+ reduction if implemented cohesively.

1) Infrastructure: build person-throughput, not car-throughput
- Rapid bus and transit priority network
  - Create 60–100 km of dedicated, camera-enforced bus lanes on top 12–15 congested corridors.
  - Implement full BRT features where feasible: physically separated lanes, off-board payment, all-door boarding, 5–8 min headways, level boarding, and intersection queue jumps.
  - Transit Signal Priority (TSP) at 80% of signalized intersections along these corridors; target 20–30% bus travel-time reductions and 15-point reliability gains.
  - Redesign the bus network for frequent, connective service; establish on-demand shuttles for low-density areas to stations.

- Citywide active mobility network
  - Build 200–300 km of protected bike lanes forming a connected spine across job centers and schools; close sidewalk gaps and add 3,000–5,000 safe crossings.
  - Provide secure bike parking at all major transit stops; expand bikeshare and e-bikeshare to full coverage with equity pricing.
  - Create 20–30 “Safe School Streets” with traffic filters during arrival/dismissal; commit to a Vision Zero design standard on all priority corridors.

- Curb and street space reallocation
  - Convert select general lanes to bus lanes or protected bike lanes; add modular medians and curb extensions to calm traffic and speed crossings.
  - Reallocate 20–30% of curb in congested districts from free parking to bus stops, delivery/loading, micromobility parking, and parklets.

- Freight and last-mile logistics
  - Establish 6–10 urban consolidation microhubs at the edge of the core; incentivize cargo e-bikes/e-vans for last mile; designate safe cargo bike routes.
  - Create off-peak (evening) delivery programs with noise mitigation; provide guaranteed loading zones with digital permitting.

2) Technology and operations: make the whole system work smarter
- Adaptive traffic management
  - Deploy adaptive signals on 300–500 intersections; integrate TSP and pedestrian priority phases. Use performance-based timing that favors person-throughput.
  - Real-time incident management: tow and clearance contracts with 15-minute response SLAs; CCTV/AI detection for stalled vehicles and illegal blocking.

- Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) and integrated fares
  - Single app/card for transit, bikeshare, carshare, on-demand shuttles; fare capping and free transfers.
  - Mobility wallets for low-income residents to use across modes.

- Curb management platform
  - Sensors or LPR for dynamic pricing/enforcement of loading zones; appointment systems for high-demand curbs; geofenced TNC pickup/drop-off.

- Data and modeling
  - Digital twin/simulation for corridor design and pricing calibration; open, anonymized data feeds for transparency and third-party innovation.

3) Policy and pricing: align incentives with city goals
- Congestion pricing
  - Phase-in a cordon charge for the central area, with time-variable rates and exemptions/discounts for low-income drivers, people with disabilities, and essential services.
  - Pilot corridor-based dynamic tolling on the most congested urban expressway.
  - Dedicate at least 70% of net revenue to transit/active mobility; 20% to road safety/maintenance; 10% to equity and small business transition support.
  - Complement with neighborhood protections (traffic calming, resident permits) to prevent spillover.

- Parking reform
  - Eliminate minimum parking requirements citywide; adopt maximums in transit-rich areas.
  - Demand-based pricing for on-street parking; employer parking cash-out mandates; phase-out free curb parking in the core.
  - Unbundle parking from leases; reinvest revenues locally.

- Land use and transit-oriented development
  - Upzone for mixed-use density within 800 m of transit corridors/stations; require inclusionary housing to curb displacement.
  - Permit corner stores, ADUs, and 15-minute neighborhood amenities to shorten trip lengths.

- Employer TDM and schedules
  - Require large employers to submit commute trip reduction plans: telework targets, compressed weeks, staggered shifts, and transit/micromobility subsidies.
  - Allow and encourage schools and public agencies to adopt staggered start times.

- Safety and speed management
  - 30 km/h (20 mph) default on local streets; automated speed enforcement at high-injury locations; daylighting at intersections.

- Ridehail and micro-mobility
  - Per-trip downtown access fee with discounts for pooled trips; cap empty cruising with geofenced staging areas.
  - Safety standards for e-bikes/scooters, speed caps on shared devices, and rider education.

4) Behavioral programs: make the better choice the easy choice
- Universal commuter benefits shift: default employee benefit is a mobility wallet usable for transit/bike, not parking; parking cash-out enforced.
- Personalized travel planning for large employers, hospitals, and universities; provide first-ride-free credits on transit/bikeshare for new users.
- Off-peak transit fare discounts; promotional “car-light weeks”; safe cycling and e-bike training.
- School travel plans with walking buses, supervised bike trains, and family incentives.

Equity, small business, and accessibility safeguards
- Revenue recycling: monthly mobility credits for low-income residents; free or discounted transit passes; grants for SMEs to adapt to delivery windows or microhubs.
- Anti-displacement: inclusionary zoning near new transit, property tax circuit breakers for long-time residents, and small-business rent stabilization tools where legal.
- ADA upgrades: 100% accessible stops, paratransit integration into MaaS, and protected curb access for accessible vehicles.
- Community engagement: co-design corridors with neighborhoods; communicate benefits in multiple languages; publish equity impact assessments.

Economic growth alignment
- Improved reliability increases labor market reach and logistics efficiency; person-throughput grows without adding car lanes.
- Prioritize freight reliability windows and provide predictable curb access to keep goods moving.
- Support construction phasing to protect retail access; marketing campaigns and wayfinding during works.

Phasing and milestones
- Year 1: Quick wins and pilots
  - Bus lanes on 5–7 corridors with paint and camera enforcement; 80 km protected bike lanes; 200 intersections retimed; parking price adjustments in core.
  - Launch MaaS app with fare capping; mobility wallet pilot; microhub pilots; employer TDM ordinance; Safe School Streets in 10 zones.
  - Set legal framework for congestion pricing; begin EIS and procurement.

- Years 2–3: Scale and harden
  - Expand to 40–60 km high-spec BRT; 150–200 km protected bike lanes; sidewalk gap closures; TSP at 60% of target intersections; full bus network redesign.
  - Curb platform citywide in busy districts; night delivery program; expand mobility wallet; TOD upzoning enacted.
  - Congestion pricing dry-run and soft launch; exemptions/discount systems tested.

- Years 4–5: Full implementation and optimization
  - Congestion pricing fully operational and optimized; additional BRT corridors complete; adaptive signals at 400+ intersections; freight microhub network operational.
  - Further parking reforms; safety program reaches all high-injury corridors; continuous improvement based on KPIs.

Risk and unintended consequences with mitigations
- Traffic diversion to neighborhoods: pre-emptive traffic calming, filters, and resident permit controls; continuous monitoring.
- Equity/regressivity of pricing: targeted discounts, mobility credits, better transit service delivered first in priced areas.
- Business disruption during construction: phased works, off-peak construction, signage, delivery access windows, financial assistance where appropriate.
- Displacement/gentrification near transit: inclusionary housing, anti-displacement funds, community land trusts, and tenant protections.
- Data privacy and surveillance concerns: minimize personal data, independent audits, opt-outs, strict retention limits, and transparent governance.
- Modal safety (e-bikes/scooters): protected infrastructure first, training, device standards, and enforcement for sidewalk riding/parking.
- Transit crowding if demand surges: procure additional fleet, hire/operators early, dynamic dispatching, and all-door boarding to maintain dwell times.
- Night deliveries and noise: equipment standards (quiet roll cages), delivery windows, and enforcement.
- Labor impacts (parking/auto sectors): workforce transition programs into transit operations, street maintenance, and logistics.

Funding
- Primary: congestion pricing and demand-based parking revenues.
- Supplementary: national/federal grants, green bonds, value capture (tax increment financing, special assessment districts near BRT/rail), developer impact fees, public–private partnerships for microhubs and MaaS, carbon credits where applicable.

Monitoring and accountability
- Quarterly publication of congestion, reliability, emissions, safety, and equity KPIs; neighborhood-level reporting to catch spillovers.
- Independent annual evaluation with the authority to recalibrate pricing, service levels, and curb allocations.
- Set interim targets: 15% congestion reduction by end of Year 2, 30% by end of Year 4, 40%+ by end of Year 5.

Why this will work
- Proven tools: London and Stockholm reduced inner-area traffic 15–25% via pricing; Paris and Bogotá showed significant mode shifts with bus lanes and cycling networks; Seattle and Washington, DC achieved large employer-based SOV reductions with TDM mandates; Barcelona’s superblocks cut through-traffic and improved local quality of life.
- The combined strategy simultaneously reduces peak car demand, increases person-throughput, and improves reliability across modes, which supports economic activity while delivering cleaner air, safer streets, and better access to opportunity.
