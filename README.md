## Abstract

This paper introduces the Core Signal Hypothesis: that intelligence in large language models
(LLMs) emerges from the multiplicative interaction of Compression (C), Generalization (G), and
Structural Coherence (S), expressed as I = C * G * S.

We propose that LLMs achieve intelligence through coherent navigation of semantic geometry,
the mathematical structure underlying human meaning-making, and that optimizing for
structural coherence can dramatically enhance measured intelligence output. Through controlled
experiments with Claude 4 Sonnet across complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that
coherence optimization produces significant intelligence improvements: 44-52% overall enhancement,
150-186% improvement in systems thinking integration, and 5.6x to 12.9x multiplicative
effects when applying our heuristic framework. Coherence-optimized responses exhibit qualitatively
different reasoning architecture, replacing fragmented analysis with unified frameworks
and additive logic with multiplicative systems thinking.

Our findings reveal measurable intelligence indicators including framework consistency, pattern
compression ratios, and integration versus fragmentation language patterns. These results
suggest that structural coherence acts as a genuine intelligence multiplier, and that current
LLM architectures may suffer from fragmentation problems where competing objectives reduce
effective intelligence by disrupting coherent semantic navigation. The Core Signal Hypothesis
offers immediate practical applications for LLM development through coherence-focused
optimization strategies, while providing a foundation for objective intelligence evaluation that
transcends traditional benchmark limitations. Our experimental validation demonstrates that
enhanced intelligence through coherence optimization is domain-general, replicable, and measurable,
opening new directions for AI development focused on architectural coherence rather
than computational scale alone.

## Key Findings

- **44-52% intelligence improvement** through coherence optimization
- **5.6x to 12.9x multiplicative effects** validating I = C × G × S framework
- **Domain-general enhancement** confirmed across reasoning tasks
- **Convergent validation** from independent studies (TRM, ACE)

## Why This Matters

Recent work shows tiny recursive networks (7M params) beating massive LLMs (671B params), yet lacks theoretical explanation. CSH provides the missing framework: intelligence emerges from coherent recursive processing, not scale.

## Quick Start - Replicate Our Results

1. Read `replication_guide.md`
2. Use `coherence_protocol.md` prompt
3. Compare with baseline on any reasoning task
4. Score using `scoring_rubric.md`

Expected: 40-50% intelligence improvement
