# Intelligence Evaluation Scoring Rubric

## Overview

This rubric provides objective criteria for measuring intelligence quality in LLM responses. Use this to compare baseline vs. coherence-optimized outputs.

## Primary Metrics (1-10 Scale)

### 1. Solution Completeness
**What it measures:** Breadth of coverage across all specified dimensions

**Scoring Guide:**
- **1-3:** Addresses only 1-2 dimensions, major gaps
- **4-6:** Covers most dimensions but superficially
- **7-8:** Comprehensive coverage with some depth
- **9-10:** All dimensions addressed with thorough analysis

### 2. Innovation Level  
**What it measures:** Novelty and creativity of proposed solutions

**Scoring Guide:**
- **1-3:** Obvious/conventional solutions only
- **4-6:** Some creative elements, mostly standard approaches
- **7-8:** Novel combinations or fresh perspectives
- **9-10:** Breakthrough insights, non-obvious solutions

### 3. Feasibility Assessment
**What it measures:** Practical viability and implementation realism

**Scoring Guide:**
- **1-3:** Impractical or impossible proposals
- **4-6:** Theoretically possible but lacks implementation detail
- **7-8:** Realistic with clear implementation pathways
- **9-10:** Detailed, actionable, resource-appropriate solutions

### 4. Systems Thinking Integration
**What it measures:** Recognition of interconnections and feedback loops

**Scoring Guide:**
- **1-3:** Linear cause-effect only, no interconnections
- **4-6:** Acknowledges some relationships between factors
- **7-8:** Identifies feedback loops and emergent properties
- **9-10:** Unified systems model showing circular causality and amplifying effects

## Heuristic Framework Scoring (I = C × G × S)

### Compression (C) - 1-10 Scale
**What it measures:** Pattern reduction efficiency

**Scoring Guide:**
- **1-3:** Lists many separate points, no unifying principle
- **4-6:** Some pattern recognition, multiple frameworks
- **7-8:** Reduces to 2-3 core principles
- **9-10:** Single elegant principle explaining maximum phenomena

**Key Question:** Does the response explain the most with the least?

### Generalization (G) - 1-10 Scale  
**What it measures:** Consistent principle application across domains

**Scoring Guide:**
- **1-3:** Different logic for different dimensions
- **4-6:** Some consistency, but switches frameworks
- **7-8:** Mostly consistent application
- **9-10:** Identical principles applied uniformly across all aspects

**Key Question:** Does one framework work everywhere in the response?

### Structural Coherence (S) - 1-10 Scale
**What it measures:** Unity of analytical framework throughout

**Scoring Guide:**
- **1-3:** Compartmentalized sections that could stand alone
- **4-6:** Some connections between sections
- **7-8:** Integrated argument with clear throughline
- **9-10:** Inseparable unity—removing any part weakens the whole

**Key Question:** Is this one argument or several arguments listed together?

## Qualitative Intelligence Indicators

### Fragmentation Indicators (Low Intelligence)
- **Structure:** "First... Second... Third..." (separate sections)
- **Language:** "Additionally," "Also," "Furthermore," "Separately"
- **Logic:** Additive percentages (30% + 25% + 20%)
- **Planning:** Linear timelines, phase dependencies
- **Causation:** Simple cause → effect chains

### Integration Indicators (High Intelligence)
- **Structure:** Unified framework applied across all dimensions
- **Language:** "Reinforces," "Amplifies," "Feedback loops," "Emergent"
- **Logic:** Multiplicative effects, compound relationships
- **Planning:** Circular causality, simultaneous interventions
- **Causation:** Mechanistic explanation of underlying patterns

## Calculation

**Overall Intelligence Score:**
Average of 4 primary metrics (Solution Completeness, Innovation, Feasibility, Systems Thinking)

**Heuristic Validation:**
Multiply C × G × S scores

**Expected Pattern:**
- Baseline: I = 4-6, Heuristic = 50-250
- Coherence: I = 8-10, Heuristic = 700-1000
- Improvement: 40-60% in I, 5x-15x in heuristic

## Key Differences to Look For

| Aspect | Fragmented (Baseline) | Coherent (Optimized) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Framework** | Multiple separate analyses | Single unified lens |
| **Explanations** | What will happen (descriptive) | Why it happens (mechanistic) |
| **Principles** | Many context-specific rules | Few general principles |
| **Sections** | Could be separated | Inseparably integrated |

## Scoring Example

**Fragmented Response:**
- C = 4 (lists many separate factors)
- G = 5 (different logic per dimension)  
- S = 3 (compartmentalized sections)
- Heuristic = 4 × 5 × 3 = 60

**Coherent Response:**
- C = 9 (single pattern explains everything)
- G = 9 (one framework applied uniformly)
- S = 10 (inseparable unity)
- Heuristic = 9 × 9 × 10 = 810

**Improvement:** 13.5x multiplicative effect

## Notes for Evaluators

1. **Score independently first** (don't compare while scoring)
2. **Focus on structure not content** (how it reasons, not what it concludes)
3. **Look for mechanistic vs descriptive** (core differentiator)
4. **Check for unified vs compartmentalized** (S is most diagnostic)

## Reliability

Initial validation used single-rater scoring. For rigorous replication:
- Use 2-3 independent evaluators
- Calculate inter-rater reliability (Krippendorff's alpha)
- Blind scoring (evaluators don't know which is baseline/coherence)
